# Apple ][ BASIC

Quite a few years ago I bartered some computer parts to someone who could 'rip' all my my Apple //c disks so they could be run in an emulator.  This is most of my homework and a lot personal 'fun' programs that I wrote in 1986-1988.  Not all of the programs are authored by me but the majority are.  


A very low friction way to run these is via a JS emulator.  I tend to use [this one](https://www.calormen.com/jsbasic/) but you won't really get a sense of how it actually worked/looked like because modern browsers can emulate 40 year old interpreted computer languages at blazing speed.
